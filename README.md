# WoW-Addon-Manager
This is an application that makes it easy to manage Addons in all versions of World of Warcraft.

I created this application as a fun way to learn about WPF and Caliburn Micro MWWM pattern. I have no idea if this application will be useful to anyone, but as i have found it very useful while using it myself, i am now releasing it for everyone to use and contribute to.

What the application currently does:

- Displays list of all installed addons with Title, Author, WoW version it was developed for, Website and description
  - The list can be sorted by clicking on the Column you want to sort it by.
  - You can search and filter the list by typing in the search box. The list will update as you type.
- Install Addons by selecting a zip file
  - The application will automatically extract, move and rename all the folders accordingly. 
  - In the future i plan to implement some sort of online search to install addons from. 
- Uninstall Addons by sellecting one or multiple addons from the list and clicking the "Uninstall Addons" button.
  - To select more than one addon you can: Drag the mouse, use CTRL + mouseclick or Shift.
- Change your WoW installion folder at any time in the Settings menu. 
  - When you change your installing folder the Addons list will automatically update.
  - I plan to implement the ability to have multiple WoW installations at a time later. 

If you have any suggestions or find any bugs please submit them here on github. And feel free to contribute if you want.
